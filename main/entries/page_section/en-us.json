Some medications, like the antiviral medicine Tamiflu®, are targeted at reducing the replication of virus in your body. When started in the first 48 hours of illness, these medicines have been shown to lower the severity and duration of the flu, as well as prevent complications. If the flu finds its way to you, University Hospitals Urgent Care can prescribe antiviral treatment, such as Tamiflu® and Xofluza®.</p>"},{"question":"What should I do to prepare for flu season?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs0c75e98e7183a736"},"answer":"<p>The CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older. While there are many different flu viruses, the flu vaccine is designed to protect against the three main flu strains that research indicates will cause the most illness during the flu season. Be sure to get your seasonal flu shot early so that you are protected throughout flu season.</p>"},{"question":"When is the flu season and when will it peak?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs6adae0887046f368"},"answer":"<p>Seasonal flu activity typically begins in October and can continue to occur as late as May, most commonly reaching its peak in January or February. In 2022, we've already started to see some flu-like illness in Michigan.</p>"},{"question":"What kinds of flu vaccines are available?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs6b66fb65cc7dce71"},"answer":"<p>There are several flu vaccine options available. They are:</p><ul><li>Trivalent: Traditional flu vaccines made to protect against three different flu viruses</li><li>Quadrivalent: Seasonal flu vaccines made to protect against four different flu viruses</li><li>High Dose Flu Vaccine: Designed for patients 65 years and older; however, this is not currently recommended over the traditional vaccine.</li></ul>"},{"question":"Can the vaccine give you the flu?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs115ffe8943170ddd"},"answer":"<p>No. The intramuscular and intradermal flu vaccine contains no live virus. It is clinically impossible to “get the flu” from the flu vaccine. Occasionally, some patients will feel a little achy after the vaccine due to activation of the immune system.</p>"},{"question":"What’s the difference between a cold and the flu? The flu and COVID?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs269436b04fce6eaf"},"answer":"<p>The common cold shares many of the same flu symptoms, but the severity of symptoms in patients with influenza is dramatically different. Below are the hallmark symptoms of the flu:</p><ul><li>Sudden onset</li><li>Severe body aches</li><li>High fever &amp; shaking chills</li><li>Painful dry cough</li><li>Runny nose, congestion, &amp; sneezing</li><li>Headache</li><li>Severe fatigue</li></ul>"},{"question":"What’s the difference between the flu and RSV?","_metadata":{"uid":"csf4e3462e6feb614a"},"answer":"<p>When it comes to the flu and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), it's difficult to determine the difference based on symptoms alone. RSV symptoms can also mimic COVID symptoms. The illnesses are caused by different viruses, and while their symptoms are similar, their treatment is very different. The best way to distinguish whether you're suffering from the flu, COVID or RSV is to take a COVID test, a flu test, and develop a care plan with a provider based on the results.</p>"},{"question":"I got the flu vaccine last year and I got “the flu” anyway, so why should I get vaccinated?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs3d760c61eb80e291"},"answer":"<p>The flu vaccine has an efficacy rate of approximately 70-80%. Cases that do slip by the vaccine are generally milder, do not last as long, and have a far lower risk of complications. The flu vaccine only prevents infection by the influenza virus. There are hundreds of other viruses that produce “flu-like illness” that the vaccine cannot prevent. If you do become sick with the flu, stay home from work or school to prevent spreading influenza to others.</p>"},{"question":"Which flu vaccine does University Hospitals Urgent Care administer?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs36af63e7242ba17c"},"answer":"<p>The flu vaccine is the traditional, trivalent vaccine and is approved for children over 4 years old and for all adults.</p>"},{"question":"Who can get a flu shot?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs533ba432b7007da5"},"answer":"<p>The traditional, trivalent flu vaccine is approved for children over 4 years old and for all adults.</p>"},{"question":"What else does University Hospitals Urgent Care do to treat influenza?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs2ff816f92891e090"},"answer":"<p>Our certified medical providers conduct a thorough examination to determine if patients are experiencing any flu-related complications, such as pneumonia or dehydration, and then work to develop a treatment plan that's right for you.</p>"}]}},{"map_section":{"title":"See our convenient clinics near you","_metadata":{"uid":"csf217001f44465e3d"},"subtitle":"Find the location nearest you.
