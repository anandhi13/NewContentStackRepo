The flu vaccine helps the body create antibodies during the two weeks after the shot is received. Once the antibodies are created, the body has a line of defense against the virus and is less susceptible to illness.</p><br/><p><strong>When should I get vaccinated?</strong></p><p>The best time to get a flu vaccination is two weeks prior to estimated flu activity in your area. On average, the flu begins to spread at the beginning of the fall season. It takes a couple of weeks after receiving the vaccine for your body to develop antibodies and begin protecting against influenza, so keep that in mind when scheduling your appointment. Even if you miss this window, flu vaccines are offered throughout the entire flu season, so you will still have the opportunity to get vaccinated.</p><br/><p><strong>Why do I need an annual vaccine?</strong></p><p>The immune protection from a flu vaccine is less effective over time, and influenza viruses are constantly evolving. Seasonal flu vaccines are developed based on the viruses that are most prevalent each season. Given this, each season’s vaccine may be different. To keep your immune system best protected, annual vaccination is the best strategy.</p><br/><p><strong>Can I get the flu from the flu vaccine?</strong></p><p>Vaccinations will not cause influenza, although you may experience mild flu-like symptoms after getting your vaccine. This is NOT the flu, but instead your immune system reacting and getting to work. Flu shots are created from inactivated viruses and therefore cannot give you the flu.</p><br/><p><strong>Could I still get the flu after being vaccinated?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, it is still possible to catch the flu even after vaccination. You may have been exposed to the flu prior to or directly after receiving your vaccine, so the flu shot would be ineffective. You may also be exposed to a virus that wasn’t included in the seasonal vaccination you received. Depending on your age and health, your immune system may still be susceptible to the virus despite receiving a vaccination and building antibodies to protect against it. However, your illness will be less severe having the vaccine two weeks prior to illness than it would be without the vaccine.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, if you do find yourself feeling ill this flu season, there is flu treatment available. If you seek treatment at the first sign of symptoms, antiviral drugs may be prescribed which can decrease both the length and severity of your illness. At <span>University Hospitals</span> Urgent Care, we provide rapid flu testing and antiviral treatment for our patients who come down with the flu. Flu treatment works best when administered within 48-72 hours of symptom onset, so the sooner you seek care, the sooner we can get you feeling better.</p><br/><p><strong>Is the flu vaccine safe?</strong></p><p>The flu vaccine is safe for almost everyone, excluding those who are allergic and others who have Guillain-Barré syndrome. Always consult a physician if you have doubts or concerns regarding your flu vaccine.</p><br/><p><strong>Should I get vaccinated if I’m pregnant or breastfeeding?</strong></p><p>It is safe for pregnant and breastfeeding individuals to receive the flu shot. In fact, the flu shot helps provide further protection to the fetus or infant, as antibodies are passed to a fetus in the womb or to a baby through breastmilk. Pregnant individuals should not receive a nasal spray vaccination.</p>","button_type":null,"button_link":{"title":"","href":""}}},{"image_and_content":{"content_header":"What side effects can I expect from the vaccine?","_metadata":{"uid":"cs56a987feae32065e"},"highlight_content_heading":false,"image":null,"image_alignment":null,"grey_section_background":false,"content":"<p>Side effects of the flu vaccination depend on the type of vaccine you receive.

Sunscreen is the base layer of protection and should be used every day — even on cloudy ones. The FDA recommendation is broad-spectrum sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 15. You should apply your sunscreen to any area of skin that will be exposed to the sun 30 minutes before exposure and reapply sunscreen generously at least every 2 hours. Lastly, keep in mind that no sunscreen is waterproof!</li><li>Wear sunglasses. Having tinted glasses over your eyes will protect them from harmful UV rays and reduce your risk of cataracts. If possible, you should invest in a pair of sunglasses that work well against UV and UVB rays. Consider polarized lenses to help reduce light glare and prevent eyestrain, further improving vision and sun safety.</li><li>Wear a hat. Any hat with a brim will offer additional protection against the sun, but the most effective ones will have brims that wrap around the entirety of the hat. Having a full, wide-brim hat will offer the most protection for your neck, ears, and face.</li><li>Choose protective clothing. Although it may be hot outside, the best protective clothes are those with the most coverage: long sleeves, pants with legs, and longer skirts. If you risk overheating by wearing these items, try to dress with tightly-woven articles of clothing. UV and UVB rays cannot penetrate through to skin as easily when you cover up with denser clothing. When heading to enjoy the water, opt for a bathing suit cover-up or even a simple t-shirt. As long as it covers more skin, it will offer a higher level of protection. Remember that wet and lighter-colored clothing is less effective at blocking the sun than dry and dark clothing.</li><li>Stay in the shade. Being outside doesn’t have to mean full-sun exposure. You can enjoy the outdoors while staying away from sunlight. Choose a fully shaded area to enjoy your activities, or bring an umbrella to provide your own shade wherever needed. Trees and outdoor shelters are other options to find shade and reduce your risk of sun damage.</li></ol><br/><p>Our urgent care team can provide care for sun-related illnesses and injuries like sunburn.
